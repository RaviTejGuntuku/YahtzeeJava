# Yahtzee in Java

Yahtzee is a dice game where a player rolls 5 dice and tries to get certain combinations.  A player can roll the dice up to 3 times in a turn.  For example, if a player rolls the dice and gets: 6, 1, 3, 6, 6 they might choose to just roll the 1 and 3 the next time.  If that returns a 2 and a 6 they might roll just the 2 and if that comes up with a 6 they have 6 of a kind, called a Yahtzee, and they would score 50 points (the highest roll possible).

Here is a link to a third-party demo of the game: https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/

To run my development of the Yahtzee game, clone the repository and compile & run the Main.java file (be sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) is installed and properly configured on your computer beforehand):

```
git clone https://github.com/RaviTejGuntuku/YahtzeeJava.git
cd YahtzeeJava
javac Main.java && java Main
